### **Mushroom-Image-Classification-Simple-CNN-Architecture**
This model uses a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to perform feature extraction and classification of mushroom species into originally two classes; edible and poisonous. Each of these two classes is subdivided into two classes namely edible mushroom sporocarp, edible sporocarp, poisonous mushroom sporocarp and poisonous sporocarp. 

**Simple CNN Models:**
Accuracy: Respectable, ranging from 90.71% to 97.94%.
Precision and Recall: Good, ranging from 73.88% to 96.30%.
AUC: Strong, ranging from 98.19% to 99.77%.
Loss: Generally low
